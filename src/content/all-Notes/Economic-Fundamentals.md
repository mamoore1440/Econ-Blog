The fundamenatls include:
* Entities
* Value & Utility
* Time
* Sin
* Money & Debt

Entities is the bedrock of the model. Humans and Products are the simplest elements.
Each fundamental adds complexity to Humans and Products.
When creating the model take it one fundamental at a time. Add complexity and Interactions but only one fundamental at a time. 


# ENTITIES:
### CORE:
- Humans & Products
  - Humans
    - This exists on a spectrum of Singular to Whole. CoH is Combinations of Humans.
      - Singular: Lisa, Kevin, etc
      - Group of n: {Lisa, Kevin, Angelina}, {Lisa, Kevin}, {Brad, Lisa, Angelina}, etc
      - Whole: Society
    - Assume Humans don't sin. 
      - Tragedy of the commons is not possible. And when Time is added niether is a tragedy of the publics.
      - This means individual ownership of Products is unneeded. 
      - Creating individual ownership of Products would be a detriment to society.
    - Singular humans may not be 100% rational. But a Society will choose to act rationally.
  - Products
    - Again this exists on a spectrum of Singular to Whole. CoP is Combinations of Products.
      - Singular: a chair, a bed, a cat, a dog, a "unit" of bread, etc
      - Group of n: {1 "unit" of rice, 1 "unit" of pork , 1 "unit" of broccoli}, {a bed, 4 walls, a roof, a door}, {Brad, Lisa, Angelina}, etc
      - Whole: Society
    - These are just products; not much to explain.
      - Chairs, Tables, Houses
      - Food, Water
      - Dogs, Cats
    - The total set of Products can be divided with an infinite number of reasons.
  - Relationship
    - Humans (society) owns all Products. 
    - No one Human "owns" any Product. 


# VALUE & UTILITY:
TODO: Take notes from the presentation you made.

### VALUE & UTILITY + ENTITIES:
- Entities:
  - Products have Value and give Utility to Humans
  - Society owns all Products and thus owns all Value
  - No one Human "owns" any Product and thus no one Human "owns" any Value

- Value & Utility:
  There is an Objective and Subjective split for Value and Utility. 
    - Terms:
      - O&S is Objective and Subjective
      - OV is Objective Value
      - SV is Subjective Value
      - OU is Objective Utility
      - SU is Subjective Utility
  - The Objective side is know by God
    - We could hypothetically "do the math"
      - It would require a really small amount of Products to find OV
      - It would require a really small amount of Products and Humans to find OU
  - The Subjective side is created by the CoH doing the subjecting.
  - Complexity:
    - There is 1 OV per Product
    - There is 1 SV per Combination of (Product + CoH)
      - This will have an error in approximation. Hyptothetically SV and OV could be equal but in the real world I doubt it.
    - There is 1 OU per Combination of (Product + CoH)
    - There is 1 SU per (Combination of (Combination of (Product + CoH)) and (CoH doing the subjecting)).
      - This is just OU being "subjected" by every possible CoH.


OV:
- Has lots of dimensions to what it is:
  - Overall value unit.
  - The relationships between each Product.
  - How many of each Product society owns.
  - Total value units for each product.
I think this is "a progression". I thinks a whole number, then a 1-D matrix, then a 2-D matrix, etc

SV:
- Subjective is created from a "value function".
  - This will obviously have an error. SV and OV could theoretically be the same but in the real world never. 

VALUE WITH TIME:
OV:
- Creative destruction is adding a new P that does something an old P did but better.
  - New P has more value than old P did when new P didn't exist.
  - Old P loses value when new P is created.
  - Thus when creative destruction occurs OV increases, old Ps lose value, and new Ps gain value.






# TIME:




# SIN:

Because Sin taints Humans you can now have a tragedy of the commons and publics. 
- Tragedy of the commons is when one generation of people consumes more than can be replenished.
  - Individuals in society casuse this tragedy
- Tragedy of the publics is when one society has more abstract demand than they should. 
  - "States" of societies in a societies lifetime create this tragedy.
  - Present society is has more abstract demand than it should.
  - Future society is worse off because they will have less demand than it should.
  - Society now has a death time. This would be when Society pulls far too much demand forward leaving a future society that is barren.
  - To not have death time it requires all demand across all time to be balanced. (Requires a extratemporal market. I would rather die with God than live forever with the Devil).

What ever Product or CoPs can go fully extinct now need a market because of the Tragedy of the commons.
Because ther is a tragedy of the publics. What ever Product or CoPs can go fully extinct now need a market.



MONEY: 

- We can create a universal numeraire for each product. 
  - This is Money
  - Money is a representation of Value. 
    - Society views it as an abstract form of Value. 
    - This allows for barter to succeed. 
    - No longer need the double coicidence of wants as both parties will always want abstract value. 
  - Money will always perfectly represent subjective value, but, in the real world, will never perfectly represent objective value.
